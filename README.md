# C-Data-Structures

This project is meant to add some simple data structes to your C projects. Written in visual studio 2017.
The project contains an implementation for a linked list, dynamic array, hash tables, and red black trees.
Usage of each data structure is shown in the test driver of each program. (TD folder).
These data structures were written mainly so that I don't need to reinvent the wheel every time I start writing code using C.
If youre using this library, please report any bugs, thanks!
